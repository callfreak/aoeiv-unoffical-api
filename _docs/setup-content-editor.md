# Setup Content Editor

The Content Editor is the main tool for creating mods in Age of Empires IV. You can either find them in your local
installation file of your game or by installing the Age of Empires IV Content Editor (Beta) on steam.

## Within the game files

As soon as you install AoE IV, you most likely also download the "<strong>EssenceEditor.exe</strong>" within the files. This is
located in the root folder of your game. For example:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Age of Empires IV
```

## By installing the AoE IV Content Editor (Beta)

### Steam

1. Make sure that you have all filters set in your "<strong>Steam-Library</strong>".
